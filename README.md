# What's This

This is my personal backup of the Kyub EmojiSearch API.
Kyub EmojiSearch API is a great emoji support library for Unity.
It is distributed only through threads on the Unity forum, but I am not sure if I will continue to use it because the package manager sometimes fails to download.
So I decided to create a backup on github.
